# DDoS Preventer: A Layered DDoS Protection Shield

This project is a Python-based transparent proxy designed to protect servers against DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks. It leverages `iptables` to intercept network traffic, analyzing it across multiple layers to block malicious traffic before it reaches your application.

It can be used to protect web servers, game servers, databases, or any other public-facing TCP service without requiring any modifications to your existing application.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Transparent Proxy Architecture:** Works with `iptables`, making it invisible to both the client and the server application.
*   **Layer 4 (TCP) Protection:** Applies rate and connection limiting for generic or encrypted TCP services like HTTPS, SSH, and MySQL.
*   **Layer 7 (HTTP) Protection:** Analyzes HTTP traffic for more intelligent mitigation.
*   **Token Bucket Rate Limiting:** Restricts the number of requests per second for each individual IP address.
*   **Connection Limiting:** Limits the total number of concurrent connections an IP can establish.
*   **Dynamic Blacklisting:** Automatically blocks IPs that exceed the limits for a configurable duration.
*   **Automatic Port Discovery:** Automatically discovers and protects all public-facing ports on the server.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The system acts as a security filter that inspects all incoming traffic before it reaches your services like Nginx.

```
          Internet User
                 |
                 v
[ Server Network Interface (Target: Port 80, 443, etc.) ]
                 |
                 | <--- iptables rule: "Redirect traffic to the Python script!"
                 v
   [ DDoS Preventer Script (Security Filter) ]
   |
   |--> 1. Blacklist Check
   |--> 2. Rate & Connection Limit Check
   |
   |--(If Threat)--> [ DROP CONNECTION ]
   |
   |--(If Safe)--> [ Forward to original destination (Nginx, etc.) ]
   |
   v
[ Your Application (Nginx, Apache, SSH Server, etc.) ]
```

## üöÄ Installation

**Prerequisites:**
*   A Linux-based operating system (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS).
*   Root (`sudo`) privileges.
*   Python 3.8+

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
```

**Step 2: Install System Dependencies**
The `iptables` and `ss` commands must be available on your system.

*   For Debian/Ubuntu:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip iptables iproute2
    ```
*   For CentOS/RHEL:
    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y python3-pip iptables iproute
    ```

**Step 3: Install Python Libraries**
From the project's root directory, install the required libraries. Note that `geoip2` is no longer needed.
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

All settings can be adjusted in the `config.py` file.

*   `TARGET_PORTS`: A base list for ports you want to protect manually (e.g., SSH).
*   `WELL_KNOWN_HTTP_PORTS`: A list of ports that the auto-discovery should classify as 'http'.
*   `DEFAULT_RATE`, `DEFAULT_BURST`: The per-IP requests per second and burst limits.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

The script must be run with `sudo` as it needs to manipulate `iptables` rules.

```bash
sudo python3 main.py
```

The script will automatically discover open ports, set up the `iptables` rules, and begin filtering traffic. To stop, press `Ctrl+C`.
